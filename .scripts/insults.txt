You're proof that God has a sense of humor.
I've seen stupid before, but your honestly on a whole 'nother level.
You were rejected a lot as a kid weren't you?
In the land of stupid, you're a king among men.
Someday you'll go far and I hope you stay there.
I thought of you today and it reminded me to take out the trash.
I wonder if you'd be smarter if your parents were second cousins instead of first.
You're impossible to underestimate.
You're not the dumbest person on the planet, but you better hope he doesn't die.
You look like something I would draw with my left hand.
You have more dick in your personality than you do in your pants.
I'd say your as dumb as a rock, but a rock can hold a door open.
