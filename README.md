![](screenshots/dotfiles1.png)

This repository is my personal dotfiles. Dotfiles are the files responsible for customization on your Linux system. This exists so that anyone can see how I have customized my Linux system. The customization files on Linux are referred to are dotfiles, because typically they begin with a period. However, dotfiles do not always begin with a period.
