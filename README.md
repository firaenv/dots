# Dotfiles
![](screenshots/dotfiles1.png)

This repository is my personal dotfiles. Dotfiles are the files responsible for customization on your Linux system. This exists so that anyone can see how I have customized my Linux system. The customization files on Linux are referred to are dotfiles, because typically they begin with a period. However, dotfiles do not always begin with a period.

# Why Do You Use Discord?
I know, I know.. Discord is what most would call "proprietary garbage." However, in my opinion it truly isn't. Windows is proprietary garbage, the software sucks arse and they want to bleed your wallet dry just for the pleasure of allowing them to spy on you. Discord on the other hand is a reliable, good looking, easy-to-use, and has wide-spread adoption. Also when it comes to chat clients like Discord I already through privacy out the window. I expect a certain level of privacy, but I know should someone with enough authority wanted to see my chat history - it could happen. 

So, TL;DR I like Discord and all my friends do too. So that's what I use - that simple. lol
